***THIS IS A STARRED QUESTION\***

I ALLOW THE FOLLOWING TO BE SHARED:
- GROUP NAMES
- CODE

Mr. Ray's Pizzeria wishes to spice up his bland take-out menu with some saucy graphics, but he's got no artistic talent of his own. Instead, Mr. Ray is offering a month of free pizza to the best design from his loyal customers!

Task: Write a program to create graphical output that resembles some kind of pizza. Artistic license is granted to freely intrepret what "pizza" actually means. Points will be given to the most aesthetically pleasing 'za.

# Description
Draws an ASCII pizza.
